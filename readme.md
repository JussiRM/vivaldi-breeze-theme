![Screenshot](/screenshots/screenshot1.jpg?raw=true)

A Vivaldi UI modification that tries to mimick the look & feel of KDE Breeze theme.
Works with light and dark theme.

## How to use?

You need to allow CSS modifications. Steps copy-pasted from here: https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/10549/modding-vivaldi

1. Open **vivaldi://experiments** (write it to address bar)
2. Enable "Allow for using CSS modifications"

Download/clone repository, then go to:

1. Vivaldi menu
2. Settings
3. Appearance (tab)
4. Go to section: Custom UI Modifications
5. Select folder: this repository.

Open a new window with Ctrl+N and the theme should be enabled.

## Notes

- Lot of normal theming options in Vivaldi settings don't work with this theme enabled.
- Vivaldi updates may break the theme if they change classnames/elements.

## Disable Theme

Simply remove the path from Vivaldi settings (Custom UI Modifications), then open a new window.
